  Hi, my name is Corey Zappo, I’m a senior system engineer with over 10 years experience. I am currently working for Morgan Lewis as a Senior System Engineer, supporting their back end infrastructure.
  I enjoy making clean and predictable solutions that are easy to implement, while also being easy to support. Implementing efficiency by identifying tasks that could be automated, and automating them with concise and predictable code utilizing PowerShell is important to me. I have worked with a range of different technologies, and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The technologies that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>PowerShell</mark>, <mark>MECM</mark>, <mark>GroupPolicy</mark>, <mark>Windows Server</mark>, <mark>Linux</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>VMware ESXi</mark> & <mark>Microsoft Hyper-V</mark>.

          I started this project as a means to only obtain the log files and it has since grown into an alerting system. I learned how to leverage the .NET FileSystemWatcher Class through this implementation and I've been proud of having this in my portfolio.

             Every company needs its infrastructure properly engineered, and Morgan Lewis is not omitted from this reality. I ensure any project I lead is properly implemented and behaves predictably. I am the subject-matter expert in most technologies and have implemented a vast array of automations that have increased the team’s ability to be productive.

        #  During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
